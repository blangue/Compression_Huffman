# Compression_huffman

Project realized during my 2nd year of preparatory class (2020) in collaboration with :
* Renan MALHERE
* Aur√©lien MASSON

## Configuration
I re-tested this project with python 3.8.10 and it works.

You will also need tkinter package to execute the code:

* For python 3:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```	
* For python 2.7:
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python-tk
```
